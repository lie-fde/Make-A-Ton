# ERC721 contract
This is the file where I have made my ERC721 contract. Clone this repo and run the commands given below:

```shell
    cd nft-marketplace
    npm install
```
After this checkout the files in this directory. I'm using the scripts/deploy.js file to deploy the contract. Checkout the hardhat.config.js which is used to configure hardhat so it can deploy to the given networks. To deploy, use the command below

```shell
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
```
If you have any doubts, ping me
